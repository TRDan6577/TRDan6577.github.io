# Flare-on 2020
This was my first reverse engineering capture the flag.

The results can be found [here](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/flare-on-7-challenge-solutions.html). Overall, I was one of 817 people to complete 6 challenges out of the 5,648 contestants registered (top 15%)

It took me a while to create the writeups for all of these challenges because I had to go back and take screenshots of the challenges. This is why the date of the posts is 2 months after the challenge ended. In some cases, my notes didn't cover a critical step in solving the problem so I had to either remember how I solved it or re-solve the challenge in order to get the screenshots I needed. Two lessons:
* No such thing as copious notes when recording content for a How-To (or How-I-Solved-This)
* Take screenshots as you go

The challenge files can be found either on the web or at [my github](https://github.com/trdan6577/writeups/tree/main/FireEye Flare-On/2020/)

# Disclaimer
I did not write the challenge files (the files included in this directory with the .7z file extension). These were written by the amazing authors at Flare-on. These files should _ONLY_ be opened in a lab or VM that's designed for malware analysis. The password for all of these files is `flare`.
