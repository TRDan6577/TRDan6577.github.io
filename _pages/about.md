**Name:** Tom Daniels

**Graduated:** Rochester Institute of Technology in 2018

**About:** I'm a computer nerd that's interested in the Windows operating system, red and blue teaming, reverse engineering, binary exploitating, and coding. I'm constantly interested in learning new things, problem solving, and automating boring tasks. You can usually find me out hiking or at a rock climbing crag.
