**Name:** Tom Daniels

**Graduated:** Rochester Institute of Technology in 2018

**About:** I'm a computer nerd that's interested in the Windows operating system, red and blue teaming, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and coding. I'm constantly trying to learn new things, problem solve, and automate boring tasks. You can usually find me hiking, rock climbing, playing ultimate frisbee, on the computer, or playing a board game.
